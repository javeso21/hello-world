# hello-world


Hola mundo!

I'm Raf! I like tacos, burritos and im new to programming! I don't know exactly where to start but C++, Java and HTML/CSS really are flirting with me..haha.. I would love to learn all those programs. I want to make a web page(dont we all); and also build an Android application, either a game or  gadget. Who knows.
